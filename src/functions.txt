Every theorem should look like this:

Theorem Theoremname (v1, v2, v3)
    Whenever
        condition1
        condition2 ; name of condition
        condition3
    Then statement
    Proof
        Some incredibly florid explaation
            line

        Some extremely well-thought-out explanation
            line
            line

        Some explanatory text, which suffices to comprise an explanation
            QED

Ore formally, a PROOF_BLOCK (statement) looks like that Proof block above, so a Theorem looks like:

Theorem Theoremname
    Whenever
        NAMED_AXIOM_LIST
    Then AXIOM
